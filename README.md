# Battleship Game


## Introduction
Battleships is a popular board game in which each player guesses the position of five ships of different length 
until they have sunk them all. In this program it has been implemented three ways: a single player game (game_engine)
in which the user doesn't have a board, a multi player game against an AI (mp_game_engine) in which the user plays
against the ai in the command line interface and a graphical multi-player game in which the board is visualised using
front end programming and back end programming.
